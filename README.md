After the v1.0.0 final NREL software distribution (04/27/2020), the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in is now independently supported and maintained with open source contributions by The OpenStudio Coalition and members of the software community at the GitHub repository https://github.com/openstudiocoalition/openstudio-sketchup-plugin. The NREL OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in repository no longer accepts new issues or pull requests.

The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in depends on the OpenStudio Application, follow the instructions at  https://openstudiocoalition.org/getting_started/getting_started/ to install the OpenStudio Application first and then install the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in.  After installing a new version of the OpenStudio Application, the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in can be configured to use the new OpenStudio Application version by pointing to the new installation directory using the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in's Preferences menu.
